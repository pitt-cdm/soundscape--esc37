My soundscape narrative starts out with a girl going through her day-to-day life with her friends, and suddenly encounters a man who has collapsed. She assesses that the man needs CPR and instructs her friend to call 911 while she performs CPR. The ambulance soon arrives and takes care of the man, as the two girls are left to go on with their day. My narrative is supposed to convey a sense of incompletion, that you may not always know the ending to a story. In addition, this narrative shows that although you may feel that your day-to-day life may be mundane or repetitive, that can change at any second.
