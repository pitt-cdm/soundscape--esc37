Currently, the file has everything up to the bystander leaving the house. 
It is supposed to sound like a "Day in the Life" in the beginning, before the bystander and the friend encounter the man who has gone into cardiac arrest.
I have not yet recorded audio on a CPR mannequin, which I am supposed to get access to this week. After this, I will also need a recording of the ambulance sirens, as well as the friend calling 911.
